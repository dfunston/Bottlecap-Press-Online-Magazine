# Bottlecap-Press-Online-Magazine

Built in late 2014, This was a site for a company that I worked with for a short time, Bottlecap Press.  The company, an independant publisher, was creating a literature magazine to publish short stories and artistic work, and wanted an online copy to match their printed version.  The magazine would come out in issues, and they wanted the web version to look very similar to a printed magazine, so a custom CMS implementation was necessary for this project.  I reused the session management code from my video site and heavily modified it, both updating and further securing the session management (since this was one of my first production sites) as well as changing how it works.  The only users capable of posting in this system were administrators, and I didn't want the admin panel open to anyone.  An existing administrator would have to add new administrators in the admin panel.  Each magazine had a number of stories per issue, and each story had author information.  Authors were stored separately from the other information, because some authors were featured multiple times in an issue, or over multiple issues would have several stories.  

The company decided to discontinue their magazine, so there is no longer a production version of the code.  The development version was taken down recently as well, so the code is the only remaining portion of this project.
