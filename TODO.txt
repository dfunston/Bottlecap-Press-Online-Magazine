Things I need to do to finish Bottlecap 1.0:

*GO BACK AND REMOVE ALL INSTANCES OF htmlspecialchars AND REPLACE WITH SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY SCRUBS SQL INPUTS
*Finish New Issue, Author, and Story pages
*Finish Manage Issue, Author, and Story pages
*Finish Story reading page
*Finish Index page
*Finish Author page
*Finish Issue page
*Finish sidebar for forward-facing pages
*Finalize design
*Tighten up security on admin pages (wash ALL SQL input, insert timeout for cookie session keys)

Minor(ish) bug fixes (BCRP 1.0/1.1):
*Change registration to fail on duplicate email address
*User management in admin panel

BCRP 1.2+ (stuff before 2.0):
*User permissions?

Further work will be part of Bottlecap 2.0
